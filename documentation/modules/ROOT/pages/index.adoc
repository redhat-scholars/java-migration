== Java Migration

In this tutorial we'll learn some of the most important additions between Java 11 LTS and the latest Java LTS (currently Java 21).

We'll cover API modifications to existing classes (String, Formatters, ...), new language features (text blocks, switch enhacement, ...), and GC/JVM for containerizing applications (flags, new algorithms).
